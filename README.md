## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I think that I did okay for this assignment, I had to remind myself of some of the concept that we had learned previously and I did need to use the solution code to figure out why the tests were not passing but in the end, I think that I learned something from this experience.
### How long it took me to finish this?
maybe about 4 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
it looks like it is similar to the h tags for html in that the Displays change size and get smaller the larger the number for the display.
